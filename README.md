Executive Summary 

The goal of this project was to assess what factors determine whether an opioid user receives treatment or not. Different factors assessed initially were variables relating to demographics, opioid usage, and treatment (facility treatment was received at, payment method for treatment, etc.). In order to develop a meaningful model that predicted whether a user receives treatment or not, no treatment variables could be used. Two different models were produced through this project. The first was a decision tree, which found the frequency of annual heroin use to be a significant predictor for whether a person receives treatment. For this, it was found that people who use heroin nearly every other day over the course of a year are more likely to get treatment than those who use it less. This can be interpreted as the threshold in which users maybe see their drug use as a severe addiction.  The other model obtained was a logistic regression model. In using this, significant variables could be narrowed down by reeditions of variable elimination. At the end of this process, four key takeaways were discovered:  younger and middle aged users are LESS likely to be treated, African American and Hispanic users are LESS likely to be treated, users with a college degree are LESS likely to be treated, and users who participate in government programs are treated MORE often.
